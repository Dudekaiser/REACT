## React
- Used to create user interfaces with JavaScript libraries.
- Unlike frameworks whose structure is ```MVC```, ```MVW```, etc., **a library that only cares about V(view)**
- component : A declaration form that determines how a specific part of a ```React``` project will occur.
- Rendering : Showing a view on the user's screen

### Initial Rendering
- Need to setup ```Initial Rendering``` in order to how the initial screen is displayed.
```
render() { ... }
```

- The ```render``` function is responsible for defining what the component looks like.
   + Returns an object containing information about the view.
   + Other components can be placed inside a component.
   + When we run the render function, the components inside it are also rendered recursively.

### Reconciliation
- When we update a view in React, it goes through a ```Reconciliation``` process.
- The render function is also responsible for updating the view when there is a change in data in the component.
  + When the component updates data, it calls the render function again with the new data.
  + When we create a view with that data, the results returned by the render function are not immediately reflected in the ```DOM```, but the component information previously created by the render function is compared with the component information created by the current render function.
  + After comparing the two views with minimal operations, find the difference between them and update the DOM tree.
