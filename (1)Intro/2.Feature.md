## Feature of REACT

### 1) Virtual DOM
- By abstracting DOM updates, the number of DOM processing is minimized and performed efficiently.
- There are three steps when data changes and updates the actual DOM in the web browser.
```
1. When date updated, re-rendering the entire UI to the Virtual DOM.
2. Compare the current content with what was in the previous Virtual DOM.
3. Only the changed parts are applied to the actual DOM.
```

- The purpose of React is to build large-scale applications with constantly changing data.
  + In other words, using Virtual DOM does not necessarily mean it is fast, but its true value can be demonstrated when used in appropriate places.
  + What React and Virtual DOM can always provide is simplicity in update processing.
 
### 2) Other features
- React is a library, not a framework, so we must directly implement and use the functions of other web frameworks, such as Ajax, data modeling, and routing.
  + Use react-router for routing, axios or fetch for Ajax processing, and redux or MobX for state management.
  + We can configure the stack to your liking, but we need access to multiple libraries.
- React can be mixed with other web frameworks or libraries.
